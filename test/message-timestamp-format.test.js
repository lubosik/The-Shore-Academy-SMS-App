/**
 * test/message-timestamp-format.test.js — every message shows its date, not
 * just its time.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY
 *
 *   The shop owner asked for the date on message timestamps "because it's
 *   easier to keep track". The thread showed "7:04 PM" and nothing else for
 *   anything sent today.
 *
 *   That reads fine while you are looking at it and badly everywhere else. A
 *   thread gets read days later, screenshotted, and pasted into a chat with
 *   somebody else, and at that point a bare time is unanchored: you cannot tell
 *   a reply that came back in four minutes from one that came the following
 *   afternoon. Diagnosing the CHECKIN20 bug needed exactly that distinction and
 *   the screenshot could not supply it.
 *
 *   Nothing was backfilled and nothing needed to be. All 218 messages here
 *   and all 3,990 in the Vici inbox this is forked from already carry a full
 *   `created_at`, none of them null, the oldest here from 6 August. The date was always stored and
 *   never shown, so this is a rendering change and every old message gains its
 *   date the moment the page reloads.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
